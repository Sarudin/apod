Astronomy Picture of the Day
============================

A place for my text-processing experiments with Astronomy Picture of the Day. I have parsed the explanations to identify likely astronomical objects and passed those through [LookUp](http://www.strudel.org.uk/lookUP/) to find their Right Ascension/Declination and object types (using the [AVM](http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_metadata.php) classification).
