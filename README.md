Astronomy Picture of the Day
============================

In updating the [@apod](http://twitter.com/apod) Twitter feed, and providing an [APOD Search](http://apod.it/), I've created a database of the text explanations for every Astronomy Picture of the Day. These are parsed from the original web pages. At the same time I have parsed the text to identify likely astronomical objects and piped those through [LookUp](http://www.strudel.org.uk/lookUP/) to find their Right Ascension/Declination and types (using the [AVM](http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_metadata.php) classification). I've converted the results of this into a large [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) file.

All the explanations come from [APOD](http://apod.nasa.gov/) so please make sure you credit them if you use this (e.g. `APOD is created by Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (UMCP)`). If you can credit me too that would be wonderful.

Note that the classification of objects and their coordinates comes from [LookUP](http://www.strudel.org.uk/lookUP/). LookUP gets data from [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) (operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France), the [NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database](http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/) (NED; operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration), the [SkyBoT project](http://www.imcce.fr/page.php?nav=webservices/skybot/) (set up under the auspice of the French Ministry for National Education and CNRS), the [Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia](http://exoplanet.eu/) (Jean Schneider, CNRS/LUTH - Paris Observatory), the [Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams Supernovae List](http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/lists/Supernovae.html) (IAU, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory), the [Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Constellation List](http://calgary.rasc.ca/constellation.htm) (Larry McNish), the [SDSS SkyServer](http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/), the [Minor Planet & Comet Ephemeris Service](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/MPEph/MPEph.html) ([IAU Minor Planet Center](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/mpc.html)), and the excellent [WCSTools package](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/) ([Doug Mink](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/mink/), Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory).
