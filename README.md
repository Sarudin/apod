Astronomy Picture of the Day
============================

In updating the [@apod](http://twitter.com/apod) Twitter feed, and providing an [APOD Search](http://apod.it/), I've created a database of the text explanations for every Astronomy Picture of the Day. These are parsed from the original web pages. At the same time I have parsed the text to identify likely astronomical objects and piped those through [LookUp](http://www.strudel.org.uk/lookUP/) to find their Right Ascension/Declination and types (using the [AVM](http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_metadata.php) classification). I've converted the results of this into a large [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) file.

All the explanations come from [APOD](http://apod.nasa.gov/) so please make sure you credit them if you use this. If you can credit me too that would be wonderful.
