The video started at the <a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/calendar/ca1009.html\">September 2010</a> equinox with the terminator line being vertical. As the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4_-R1vnJyw\">Earth revolved</a> around the Sun, the <a href=\"http://www.lizard-tail.com/isana/lab/astro_calc/terminator.html\" >terminator</a> was seen to tilt in a way that provides less daily sunlight to the northern hemisphere, <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/75843/why-are-there-seasons/\">causing winter</a> in the north. As the year progressed, the <a href=\"http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/calendar/ca1103.html\">March 2011</a> equinox arrived halfway through the video, followed by the terminator tilting the other way, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons#Causes_and_effects\">causing winter</a> in the southern hemisphere -- and summer in the north. The captured year ends again with the <a href=\"ap120923.html\">September equinox</a>, concluding another of billions of trips the Earth has taken -- and will take -- around the Sun.","credit":"<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Meteosat/index.html\" >Meteosat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/people/RSimmon.html\" >Robert Simmon</a>" },
